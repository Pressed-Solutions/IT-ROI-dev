#To do when theme conversion is finished

 - Update links to images directory such as [this commit](https://github.com/Pressed-Solutions/IT-ROI-dev/commit/3bfd09dc040f4f8046081360e2771929ac1c7aaf)
 - Remove unnecessary custom field groups from Sharepoint and Integration post types
 - Go through existing functions.php to see what needs to be kept in responsive site

#“Do It Right” Upgrades
 - Footer social links: SVG icons, actual text
